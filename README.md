# ANN-based ML Model
• Used ANN to predict the glass transition temperatures of various multicomponent oxide glasses with as high as 65 elements
• Implemented a Multilayer perceptron model with 2 hidden layers; included dropout routine to avoid overfitting
• Achieved an R² score of 0.925, indicating major capture of patterns between the input features and the target variable
